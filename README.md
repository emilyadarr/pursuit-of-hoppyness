# Pursuit of Hoppyness

Pursuit of Hoppyness is a brewery finder dashboard to allow users to search a city for local breweries and find hours of operation and reviews. Users can also save their favorite breweries to a list for easy access. 

This was a group project completed by Emily Darr, Kelly Dingman, Corey Gettig, Ben Sharpe and Thomas Siffermann. Special thanks to Kim Donlan for the logo design. Pursuit of Hoppyness was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Tailwind, Moment.js, Yelp API and OpenBrewery API.
